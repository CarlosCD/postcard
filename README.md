## Postcard

Simple Ruby program to compose holiday cards, ready to print, given some digital
images.

It requires ImageMagick, which in macOS it can be installed with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

    brew install imagemagick

Example of usage (with the sample image files):

    ./postcard.rb samples/white_page.png samples/artwork_upsidedown.png

This is just a simple utility for me to use, more to come soon, maybe.
